## Overview

Our team instantiated an entire EC2 instance to create our weather getter service. When we were conducting our research, we came across a solution that was cheaper and easier to use. Introducing, AWS Lambda.

AWS Lambda is an event-driven, serverless computing platform provided by Amazon as a part of Amazon Web Services. It is a computing service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the computing resources required by that code. It was introduced in November 2014.
